# TinyApp Project

Tiny App is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (similar to bit.ly).

## User Interface

## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Express
- EJS
- bcrypt
- body-parser
- cookie-session

## Getting Started

- Install all dependencies (using the `npm install` command).
- Run the development web server using the `node express_server.js` command.
- Once up and running, register and create shortenened links and edit/delete them as you please.
- You will have to tie in your own database if you want persistence as this runs on short term memory only right now.
